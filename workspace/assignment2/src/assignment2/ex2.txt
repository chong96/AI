Exercise 2.1
1. In goal formulation, one decides which aspects are desired. The goal is set and one has to assess which states will
fulfill the goal. In problem formulation one decides what states need to be considered and manipulated and what not. 
So if problem formulation is done before goal formulation, one will not know what the goal is or what is desired so
states to be considered would be unknown.

2. a) If there were negative values, any optimal algorithm would traverse those paths since the goal would be to get
to the goal with the least amount of weight and negative values would do that.
b) It does help if we insist that step costs must be greater than or equal to negative constant c. 
If c is the best case scenario, then paths x can be improved by multiplying c and x with cx.That means the best path
has to be cx.
c) If all the actions have negative costs but no net change to the state, then that means the agent will loop
continuously.
d) Although scenic routes are nice to drive through, its impractical to go on them every time. People only want to drive
on scenic routes once or a couple times. To make the agents only traverse a certain amount of times and avoid looping,
one can put a counter that goes up every time it hits that route so it can then be limited.
e) A real world domain could be going to high school 7-2 or going to work from 9-5 everyday.

2.2
2) It is not necessary to check for repeated states, the algorithm will do the optimal choice.
3) Humans have a hard time solving this problem because thinking logically about it can get confusing if you are not
completely focused on every step and looking ahead to see how one can get to the goal state.
